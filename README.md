STEP-BY-STEP PHONEGAP TUTORIAL

This is "My first PhoneGap 3.x app - A tutorial by dissection" tutorial in HTML format (PDF, ePub etc coming later)

It's a step-by-step tutorial for PhoneGap beginners. Follow this tutorial to
build a complete app from scratch. You should know a little bit about JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

The tutorial assumes *nothing* and is very hand-holdy. It includes a lot of
screenshots. Try it!
